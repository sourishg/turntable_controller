## [Unreleased]

## [0.1.21] - 2018-06-26

### Fixed
- Compensate for assembly error on some MBm0.5.2 boards by ignoring the version read from EEPROM

### Added
- VN100 driver improvements: now uses async update, fixes euler angle "noise", and adds miscellaneous performance improvements
- Unified microcontroller and other architectures in the task scheduling
- SDK auto install script
- Robot port autodetect (Stand example)
- Example and debug documentation

## [0.1.20] - 2018-06-21

### Fixed
- `clockTimeUS()` is now a function; now actually useful for profiling

### Added
- Task priorities and running order updated so behavior gets the latest states and the latest commands are sent. Behavior now runs at the same priority as lower-level updates.
- ADC continuous sampling (example in FirstHop)
